// Smithy doesn't allow passing resources or services as members of structures, 
// since it doesn't make sense in a client-server world to pass these over the
// wire. However, in our world we do want to be able to pass around references
// to things like Keyrings, so we create a new trait which indicates that 
// a target shape is not actually a structure but instead an opaque reference
// to a service or resource.
@trait(selector: "structure")
structure reference {
  // Can refer to either services or resources
  // @idRef(failWhenMissing: true, selector: "structure")

// Trait indicates that the member of the given structure MUST be expanded.
// To be used when we want operations to accept
// or return bare values rather than a nested structure.
// Code generation SHOULD throw an error if this is applied to a structure
// that is not used as input or output to an operation.
// At this time,
// Code generation MUST throw an error if this is applied to a structure
// with more than or less than one member.
// i.e: The structure MUST have one and only one member.
// At this time,
// the sole member's requirement status MUST NOT be determined by
// the positional trait.

// A trait indicating that the resource may be implemented by native code (instead of Dafny code).
// i.e.: Users may author their own classes that implement and extend this resource.
// Polymorph MUST generate and utilize NativeWrappers for these resources.
// Polymorph MUST generate conversion methods capabale of wrapping & un-wrapping
// these native resources.
// i.e.: The wrapping MUST NOT be a one way door.
