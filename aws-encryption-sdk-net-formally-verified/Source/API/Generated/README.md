This code was generated using the instructions in <https://tiny.amazon.com/7mjsg3oc>,
and was formatted using default formatting settings in JetBrains Rider
(select all generated-code directories, select "Code > Reformat" Code in toolbar).

Before doing so, ensure that Rider is configured to add newlines at the end of
every file on save (Preferences > Editor > Code Style > C# > "Line Breaks and Wrapping" tab > "Line feed at end of file")
otherwise your diff will be polluted by newline removal.
