This example sets up the AWS KMS Discovery Multi Keyring and demonstrates decryption
using a Multi-Keyring containing multiple AWS KMS Discovery Keyrings.

The AWS Encryption SDK provides a standard AWS KMS discovery keyring and a discovery keyring
for AWS KMS multi-Region keys. For information about using multi-Region keys with the
AWS Encryption SDK, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/configure.html#config-mrks

Because it doesn't specify any wrapping keys, a discovery keyring can't encrypt data.
If you use a discovery keyring to encrypt data, alone or in a multi-keyring, the encrypt
operation fails.

When decrypting, a discovery keyring allows the AWS Encryption SDK to ask AWS KMS to decrypt
any encrypted data key by using the AWS KMS key that encrypted it, regardless of who owns or
has access to that AWS KMS key. The call succeeds only when the caller has kms:Decrypt
permission on the AWS KMS key.

This example creates a KMS Keyring and then encrypts a custom input EXAMPLE_DATA
with an encryption context. This encrypted ciphertext is then decrypted using the Discovery Multi
keyring. This example also includes some sanity checks for demonstration:
1. Ciphertext and plaintext data are not the same
2. Decrypted plaintext value matches EXAMPLE_DATA
These sanity checks are for demonstration in the example only. You do not need these in your code.

For more information on how to use KMS Discovery keyrings, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/use-kms-keyring.html#kms-keyring-discovery
