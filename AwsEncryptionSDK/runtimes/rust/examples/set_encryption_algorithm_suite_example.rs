This example demonstrates how to set an algorithm suite while using the Raw AES Keyring
in the AWS Encryption SDK.

The algorithm suite used in the encrypt() method is the algorithm used to protect your
data using the data key. By setting this algorithm, you can configure the algorithm used
to encrypt and decrypt your data.

Algorithm suites can be set in a similar manner in other keyrings as well. However,
please make sure that you're using a logical algorithm suite that is compatible with your
keyring. For more information on algorithm suites supported by the AWS Encryption SDK, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/supported-algorithms.html

The AES wrapping algorithm (AesWrappingAlg::AlgAes256GcmIv12Tag16) protects your data key using
the user-provided wrapping key. In contrast, the algorithm suite used in the encrypt() method
is the algorithm used to protect your data using the data key. This example demonstrates setting the
latter, which is the algorithm suite for protecting your data. When the commitment policy is
RequireEncryptRequireDecrypt, the default algorithm used in the encrypt method is
AlgAes256GcmHkdfSha512CommitKeyEcdsaP384, which is a committing and signing algorithm.
Signature verification ensures the integrity of a digital message as it goes across trust
boundaries. However, signature verification adds a significant performance cost to encryption
and decryption. If encryptors and decryptors are equally trusted, we can consider using an algorithm
suite that does not include signing. This example sets the algorithm suite as
AlgAes256GcmHkdfSha512CommitKey, which is a committing but non-signing algorithm.
For more information on digital signatures, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html#digital-sigs

This example creates a Raw AES Keyring and then encrypts a custom input EXAMPLE_DATA
with an encryption context and the algorithm suite AlgAes256GcmHkdfSha512CommitKey.
This example also includes some sanity checks for demonstration:
1. Ciphertext and plaintext data are not the same
2. Decrypted plaintext value matches EXAMPLE_DATA
These sanity checks are for demonstration in the example only. You do not need these in your code.
