/// <summary>
/// This example demonstrates how to use a shared cache across multiple Hierarchical Keyrings.
/// With this functionality, users only need to maintain one common shared cache across multiple
/// Hierarchical Keyrings with different Key Stores instances/KMS Clients/KMS Keys.
/// 
/// There are two important parameters that users need to carefully set while providing the shared cache:
/// 
/// Partition ID - Partition ID is an optional parameter provided to the Hierarchical Keyring input,
/// which distinguishes Cryptographic Material Providers (i.e: Keyrings) writing to a cache.
/// - If the Partition ID is set and is the same for two Hierarchical Keyrings (or another Material Provider),
///   they CAN share the same cache entries in the cache.
/// - If the Partition ID is set and is different for two Hierarchical Keyrings (or another Material Provider),
///   they CANNOT share the same cache entries in the cache.
/// - If the Partition ID is not set by the user, it is initialized as a random 16-byte UUID which makes
///   it unique for every Hierarchical Keyring, and two Hierarchical Keyrings (or another Material Provider)
///   CANNOT share the same cache entries in the cache.
/// 
/// Logical Key Store Name - This parameter is set by the user when configuring the Key Store for
/// the Hierarchical Keyring. This is a logical name for the branch key store.
/// Suppose you have a physical Key Store (K). You create two instances of K (K1 and K2). Now, you create
/// two Hierarchical Keyrings (HK1 and HK2) with these Key Store instances (K1 and K2 respectively).
/// - If you want to share cache entries across these two keyrings, you should set the Logical Key Store Names
///   for both the Key Store instances (K1 and K2) to be the same.
/// - If you set the Logical Key Store Names for K1 and K2 to be different, HK1 (which uses Key Store instance K1)
///   and HK2 (which uses Key Store instance K2) will NOT be able to share cache entries.
/// 
/// This is demonstrated in the example below.
/// Notice that both K1 and K2 are instances of the same physical Key Store (K).
/// You MUST NEVER have two different physical Key Stores with the same Logical Key Store Name.
/// 
/// Important Note: If you have two or more Hierarchy Keyrings with:
/// - Same Partition ID
/// - Same Logical Key Store Name of the Key Store for the Hierarchical Keyring 
/// - Same Branch Key ID
/// then they WILL share the cache entries in the Shared Cache.
/// Please make sure that you set all of Partition ID, Logical Key Store Name and Branch Key ID
/// to be the same for two Hierarchical Keyrings only if you want them to share cache entries.
/// 
/// This example first creates a shared cache that you can use across multiple Hierarchical Keyrings.
/// The example then configures a Hierarchical Keyring (HK1 and HK2) with the shared cache,
/// a Branch Key ID and two instances (K1 and K2) of the same physical Key Store (K) respectively,
/// i.e. HK1 with K1 and HK2 with K2. The example demonstrates that if you set the same Partition ID
/// for HK1 and HK2, the two keyrings can share cache entries.
/// If you set different Partition ID of the Hierarchical Keyrings, or different
/// Logical Key Store Names of the Key Store instances, then the keyrings will NOT
/// be able to share cache entries.
///
/// This example requires access to the DDB Table (K) where you are storing the Branch Keys. This
/// table must be configured with the following primary key configuration: - Partition key is named
/// "partition_key" with type (S) - Sort key is named "sort_key" with type (S)
///
/// This example also requires using a KMS Key. You need the following access on this key:
/// - GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
/// - Decrypt
