/// <summary>
/// This example sets up the Hierarchical Keyring, 
/// which establishes a key hierarchy
/// where "branch" keys are persisted in DynamoDb.
/// These branch keys are used to protect your data keys,
/// and these branch keys are themselves protected by a KMS Key.
/// 
/// Establishing a key hierarchy like this has two benefits:
/// 
/// First, by caching the branch key material, and only calling
/// KMS to re-establish authentication regularly according to your configured TTL,
/// you limit how often you need to call KMS to protect your data.
/// This is a performance/security tradeoff, where your authentication, audit, and
/// logging from KMS is no longer one-to-one with every encrypt or decrypt call.
/// Additionally KMS Cloudtrail cannot be used to distinguish Encrypt and Decrypt calls,
/// and you cannot restrict who has Encryption rights from who has Decryption rights
/// since they both ONLY need KMS:Decrypt.
/// However, the benefit is that you no longer have to make a
/// network call to KMS for every encrypt or decrypt.
/// 
/// Second, this key hierarchy facilitates cryptographic isolation
/// of a tenant's data in a multi-tenant data store.
/// Each tenant can have a unique Branch Key,
/// that is only used to protect the tenant's data.
/// You can either statically configure a single branch key
/// to ensure you are restricting access to a single tenant,
/// or you can implement an interface that selects 
/// the Branch Key based on the Encryption Context.
/// 
/// This example demonstrates configuring a Hierarchical Keyring
/// with a Branch Key ID Supplier to encrypt and decrypt data for
/// two separate tenants.
/// 
/// This example requires access to the DDB Table where you are storing the Branch Keys.
/// This table must be configured with the following
/// primary key configuration:
/// - Partition key is named "partition_key" with type (S)
/// - Sort key is named "sort_key" with type (S)
/// 
/// This example also requires using a KMS Key.
/// You need the following access on this key:
/// - GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
/// - Decrypt
