#
# This local action serves two purposes:
#
# 1. For core workflows like pull.yml and push.yml,
#    it is uses to check that the checked in copy of generated code
#    matches what the current submodule version of smithy-dafny generates.
#    This is important to ensure whenever someone changes the models
#    or needs to regenerate to pick up smithy-dafny improvements,
#    they don't have to deal with unpleasant surprises.
#
# 2. For workflows that check compatibility with other Dafny versions,
#    such as nightly_dafny.yml, it is necessary to regenerate the code
#    for that version of Dafny first.
#    This is ultimately because some of the code smithy-dafny generates
#    is tightly coupled to what code Dafny itself generates.
#    A concrete example is that Dafny 4.3 added TypeDescriptors
#    as parameters when constructing datatypes like Option and Result.
#
#    This is why this is a composite action instead of a reusable workflow:
#    the latter executes in a separate runner environment,
#    but here we need to actually overwrite the generated code in place
#    so that subsequent steps can work correctly.
#
# This action assumes that the given version of Dafny and .NET 6.0.x
# have already been set up, since they are used to format generated code.
#
# Note that recursively generating code doesn't currently work in this repo
# with the version of the mpl pinned by the submodule,
# because the SharedMakefileV2.mk in it doesn't work with newer versions of smithy-dafny.
# Therefore by default we don't recursively regenerate code
# (accomplished by setting the POLYMORPH_DEPENDENCIES environment variable to "").
# If `update-and-regenerate-mpl` is true, we first pull the latest mpl,
# which is necessary both for Makefile compatibility and so we can regenerate mpl code
# for compatibility with newer versions of Dafny.
