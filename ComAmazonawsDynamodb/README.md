# DDB Model

This AWS-DDB module is a work in progress, and currently requires some updates in order to successfully build a model and corresponding types with Polymorph.



### Development Requirements

This library builds and verifies with the following:
- dotnet 6.0.400
- dafny 3.9.0

TODO: Better define and maintain (via CI) dev dependencies for this module

### Build

#### (Optional) Rebuild the model

If you have updated the smithy model, you will also need to re-generate the corresponding models.

```
./generate-from-model.sh
```

This will generate the Dafny Types file from the smithy model.
TODO: Also have this generate the .NET and Java.

##### DDB Polymorph-generated Dafny Changes

The following changes were done to the Dafny code generated by the DDB model to accomodate Polymorph's and Dafny's current limitations:

- Any params named "Keys" or "Items" in `ComAmazonawsDynamodbTypes.dfy`
  were updated to "KeyList" or "ItemList". See: https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1209

#### Compile Dafny into .NET

```
make compile_net
```

Compiles the dafny code into .NET.
