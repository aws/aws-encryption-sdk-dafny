//# If the input encrypted message is being streamed (streaming.md) to
//# this operation:
//# *  Output MUST NOT be released until otherwise indicated.
//# *  If all bytes have been provided and this operation is unable to
//# complete the above steps with the consumable encrypted message
//# bytes, this operation MUST halt and indicate a failure to the
//# caller.
//# *  If this operation successfully completes the above steps but there
//# are consumable bytes which are intended to be decrypted, this
//# operation MUST fail.
//# *  The ESDK MUST provide a configuration option that causes the
//# decryption operation to fail immediately after parsing the header
//# if a signed algorithm suite is used.
